        <h3>Booking, terms and conditions</h3>
<p>These conditions below apply where you yourself or through a third party enter into an agreement with SkavstaAdventure in line with that set out in the booking confirmation. The agreement may concern accommodation, transport of luggage, purchase of other products and services, or a combination of these.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Booking</h3>
<p>Bookings are made via a form on the website or by e-mail to info@skavstaadventure.se. You can also phone +46 704 66 80 90. We register the booking and if all the details are correct, we send a confirmation with a booking number and payment information by e-mail or by post. Your booking will be binding for you and for SkavstaAdventure as soon as it has been confirmed orally or in writing by us. The booking terms and conditions apply immediately whether you have paid the full amount, made a part payment or have not paid at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Payment</h3>
<p>A deposit of 20% of the total price of the package (deducted from the final payment) must be paid no later than 10 days after receiving your booking confirmation. The rest of the amount must be received by SkavstaAdventure no later than 30 days before the start of the trip. If you do not pay in time, your booking will be cancelled and you will be charged in line with the rules under Cancellation charges, see below. If you book later than 30 days before arrival, the entire payment must be made immediately on booking.</p>
<p>The price of travel listed is per person based on occupancy in a double bed room. If available, a single bed room can be booked for a surcharge. In some hotels however there are only a limited number of single bed rooms meaning that you may if necessary have to make due with a simpler room or, under certain circumstances, have to go to another hotel or private bed and breakfast. If, exceptionally, no single bed room can be made available, you will have to share a room in a two bed room. In this case you will of course receive a prorated refund.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can cancel your booking by e-mail to info@skavstaadventure.se State your booking number. Cancellation does not count if you cancel on behalf of a third party or directly to one of the providers of the package. Cancellation only applies once you have received a confirmation of your cancellation from SkavstaAdventure. In the event of cancellation, charges are payable as set out in the rules on Cancellation charges, see below. SEK 500 is charged for re-booking a date or package.</p>

If a transport service or an event included in your booking is cancelled at short notice, a refund will only be given for the transport service/event concerned. If you have complaints you must make them to us within 3 days of the arrival date. Errors arising during your stay must be reported immediately. This should initially be done to the seller/facility.
